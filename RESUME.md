## Professional Experience
### Customer Engineer // [Google Cloud Japan G.K.](https://cloud.google.com)

**January 2020 to present**



### Software Engineer // [Wondershake Ltd.](https://wondershake.com/)

**August 2017 to December 2019**

* Migrated the infrastructure of applications from VM-based architecture on AWS to containerized architecture on Google Kubernetes Engine, restructuring applications to optimize them into containerized architecture.Â     
* Built a simple search engine for pictures based on cosine similarity of recognized objects from Vision API, in order to replace unlicensed pictures in articles with similar appropriate pictures. It was written in Go.
* Developed a machine learning model to classify articles with scikit-learn, Python. Built and provided the prediction API on the model as a gRPC API.
* Launched multi-cloud data processing platform: transfer access logs and application logs from AWS to Google Cloud, transform raw data into well-formatted data on Cloud Dataflow, and load data into BigQuery.
* Tuned backend API performance to render rapidly on mobile and to reduce backend load.

### Server-side Tech Lead // [Goodpatch Inc.](https://global.goodpatch.com/)

**May 2016 to July 2017**

* Launched a new product as a tech lead of backend apps, designing and implementing backend applications with Go and Kubernetes to provide a RESTful API for a single page application. Worked closely with the frontend app team, the designer team and the product team, and common language in these teams was English.
* Architected applications, directed the tech team, improved EngProd, and educated junior developers as a tech lead.
* Optimized backend applications written in Ruby, for example, I made copying projects of a product twice faster avoiding a lot of N+1 queries.

### Software Engineer // [IDC Frontier Inc.](https://www.idcf.jp/en/company/)

**April 2013 to April 2016**

* Launched '[<ins>load balancer as a service</ins>](https://www.idcf.jp/cloud/ilb/)' in [<ins>IDCF Cloud</ins>](https://www.idcf.jp/en/cloud/) (Japanese domestic public cloud). I designed the whole architecture that scaled based on each component, and implemented them with Ruby, RabbitMQ, Percona XtraDB Cluster, Influx DB and HA proxy. REST API service provided the endpoint for users. Asynchronous workers, which were designed as idempotent, provisioned LB instances, networks and any other infrastructure. I developed an async job worker framework for it to operate infrastructure in idempotent ways. As well as developing workers, I tested capabilities of self-healing by injecting failures with this framework. Agent was embedded in LB instances to operate and configure them, subscribing command queues. Metrics collectors embedded in LB instances collected metrics like traffic and CPU usage. Aggregator aggregates metrics to trigger automatic operations such as recovering from failure, and to charge users for traffic.
* Published API clients for cloud services as open-source software on GitHub.
* Collaborated with international teams in the US and India.
* Communicated with internal teams and stakeholders to integrate applications, infrastructure, security, network and operations, and to get agreements of business requirements.
